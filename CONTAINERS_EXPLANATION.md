# Cloudflare Containers Implementation Notes

## Understanding @cloudflare/containers

After examining the `@cloudflare/containers` package, it's clear that this is **NOT** an API client for managing containers remotely. Instead, it's a helper library for creating **Durable Objects that can run containers**.

### What @cloudflare/containers Actually Is

The package provides:
- `Container` class that extends `DurableObject`
- Helper utilities for container lifecycle management within Durable Objects
- Types for container configuration and events

### Architecture Requirements

To properly use Cloudflare Containers, you need:

1. **Wrangler Configuration** (`wrangler.toml`):
```toml
[containers]
[[containers]]
class_name = "UserAppContainer"
image = "./Dockerfile"  # or a base image
max_instances = 10

[durable_objects]
[[durable_objects.bindings]]
name = "USER_CONTAINERS"
class_name = "UserAppContainer"

[[migrations]]
tag = "v1"
new_sqlite_classes = ["UserAppContainer"]
```

2. **Container Class Implementation**:
```typescript
import { Container } from '@cloudflare/containers';

export class UserAppContainer extends Container {
  defaultPort = 8000;
  sleepAfter = "10m";
  envVars = { NODE_ENV: 'production' };

  async onStart() {
    console.log('Container started');
  }
}
```

3. **Worker Integration**:
```typescript
export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
    const id = env.USER_CONTAINERS.idFromName('user-123');
    const container = env.USER_CONTAINERS.get(id);
    return container.fetch(request);
  }
};
```

### Current Implementation Status

The current code in `management.ts` attempts to use the package as an API client, which is incorrect. The package is designed for:
- **Durable Objects with container runtime support**
- **Worker-to-container communication**
- **Container lifecycle management within DO context**

### Recommended Approach

For the file upload feature, we have two options:

1. **Use Cloudflare Workers + Containers (Recommended)**:
   - Implement proper Durable Object classes
   - Configure containers in `wrangler.toml`
   - Use the `Container` class properly

2. **Use Cloudflare API directly**:
   - Make HTTP calls to Cloudflare's container management API
   - Handle authentication via API tokens
   - Manage container lifecycle through REST endpoints

The current implementation should be updated to use one of these proper approaches.
